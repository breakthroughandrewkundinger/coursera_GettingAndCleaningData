The purpose of this code book is to describe the variables, data, and transformations are performed to clean up the data and perform calculations.
Source of Data
•	Original data:  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
•	Original description of the dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
Data Information (via Coursera)
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
Data Files
The dataset includes the following files:
•	'README.txt'
•	'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
•	'features.txt': List of all features.
•	'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
•	'train/x_train.txt': Training set.
•	'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
•	'test/x_test.txt': Test set.
•	'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.
•	'train/subject_train.txt': Each row defines subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. Each subject is represented by an id in this range. 
•	'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis as measured in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. This also applies for the 'total_acc_y_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.
•	'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.
•	'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
Transformation sections
There are 5 key sections:
1.	Combines the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Obtains only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.	Applies activity names to describe the activities in the data set
4.	Labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5.	Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
In summary, run_analysis.R performs these high level steps: 
•	Load reshapre2, data.table and dplyr libraries
•	Load both test and train data
•	Load the features and activity labels.
•	Extract the mean and standard deviation column names and data.
•	Process the data for the test and train datasets respectively.
•	Combine data set.
•	Write the file to the working directory
